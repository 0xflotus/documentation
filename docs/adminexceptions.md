# Monitor and handle exceptions

Lightrun can monitor all exceptions that are thrown in the application, and then offer insights about those exceptions. 

You can: 

- [configure the agent for exceptions](adminexceptions-configure.md)

- [view exceptions from the browser](manageexceptions.md)

- [view exceptions from the IDE](userexceptions.md)

!!! note
    By default, every exception in the application is reported, including those caught by your exception handler.
