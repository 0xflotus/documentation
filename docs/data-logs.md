# Collect all log output

Agent logs are collected and made available for troubleshooting if any issues arise while using Lightrun. Managers can work with agent logs as follows: 

- Collect logs from all active agents 

- Download any of the collected output

- Delete log output - this only deletes the output you've collected

!!! note
    This is not related to the Lightrun log action, but rather the logs collected for running agents.
