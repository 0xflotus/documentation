# Troubleshooting log and metric integrations

If you experience any trouble in your integrations, check these settings: 

- Ensure you've properly [configured piping](observability-integrations.md) from the IDE and have set it to either App or Both.

- Once you send logs, wait a few minutes to give the platform time to index and make them available for search. This normally happens anywhere between seconds to one minute, but sometimes it can take longer.

- Check for network connectivity issues and firewall configurations.
