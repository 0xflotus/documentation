# Agent administration: overview

It's best to calibrate agent configurations and related settings in order to maximize Lightrun functionality. 

Once you [add the agent to your app](install-agent.md), you can: 

- [Customize Maven and Gradle configurations](maximize.md) to maximize the data delivered by Lightrun  

- [Customize agent configuration](agentadmin-agentprops.md) - by adjusting any of the available multiple properties

- [Manage tags](agentadmin-tagging.md) - in order to group agents together based on meaningful taxonomies

- [Manage services](manage-services.md) - service configurations

- [Manage data security](data-security.md) - blocklisting and data redaction
