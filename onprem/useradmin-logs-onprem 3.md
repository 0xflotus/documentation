{==Server's logs can be found under `/tmp/lightrun-backend-server.log`. What is this for? and how is it different than Entities=>Actions or just logs? is this referring to the Send logs by email option? Or something else? ==}

If there is a server side error, send logs to provide an easy way to send logs by email directly from the web UI.
